## I like keeping my tmux config as minimal as possible. Based on work by Peter Jang at
## https://medium.com/actualize-network/a-minimalist-guide-to-tmux-13675fb160fa and by 
## github.com/spciycode.

# remap prefix from 'C-b' to 'C-a'
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# trying to make cool split window hotkeys
bind-key | split-window -h
bind-key - split-window -v

# move panes with alt+arrows without prefix
bind -n M-Left select-pane -L
bind -n M-Right select-pane -R
bind -n M-Up select-pane -U
bind -n M-Down select-pane -D

# make sure ps1 highlighting is enabled in sessions
set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"
